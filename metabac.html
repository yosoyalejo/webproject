      The bacterial community in the intestines of fish, the so-called gut
      microbiome, interacts in various ways with the metabolism and immune
      system of its host. However, there is no precise description of these
      interactions, especially for commercially used fish species. Microbiome
      research in aquaculture has so far mainly focused on the structural
      composition of the bacterial community (who is there?) And hardly on its
      function (what can it do?). Previous studies have already shown that the
      husbandry environment, genetic origin, physiological changes, stress
      levels and, above all, feed have an effect on the structural composition
      of the microbiome. The planned research project therefore focuses on a
      functional characterization of the fish microbiome through a
      metatranscriptome analysis of the intestinal microbiome and examines both
      the structure and the functional properties of the intestinal microbiome
      of rainbow trout depending on various feeding strategies and continuous
      stress. Above all, own preliminary work on the influence of feed on the
      intestinal microbiome and previous research results on the effect of the
      bacterial community on the stress resistance of fish form the basis for
      the hypothesis that the microbiome could establish a connection between
      nutrient supply and stress resistance. Successful aquaculture is based
      above all on an optimal supply of nutrients and a stress-free housing
      environment. In commercial fish farms in particular, chronic husbandry
      stress has a strong effect on fish growth and thus on the success of
      production, despite optimal feeding. Since earlier studies also suggest an
      influence of the genetic background on the composition of the microbiome,
      this is also considered by directly comparing trout from two different
      breeding lines in a special test approach. The data set to be determined
      will not only enable a structural analysis of the microbial community in
      the fish intestine (who is there?), But above all also a functional
      characterization of the microbiome (what can it do?), And will thus create
      an important gap in understanding Infer the structure and function of the
      microbiome in aquaculture species.
